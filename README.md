# 🌼 Iris Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This notebook contains a beginner-friendly EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the classic Iris dataset.

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas
- Explored it with basic statistics and insights
- Created 5 visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Wrote chill, human-style takeaways based on the patterns I noticed

## 🖼️ Screenshots of Plots

I've included 5 visual screenshots of the data visualizations I created.

- `SS1` – Distribution plot of Sepal Length  
- `SS2` – Boxplot comparing Petal Length across species  
- `SS3` – Pairplot of all features  
- `SS4` – Scatterplot of Sepal Length vs Width
- `SS5` – Correlation heatmap

## 🙋‍♂️ About

This was done as part of my weekly task submission for a beginner-level data storytelling and visualization activity.  
It was fun exploring the data and actually seeing patterns come to life through visuals.
